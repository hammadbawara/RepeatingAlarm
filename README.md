# Repeating Alarm

Welcome to the **Repeating Alarm** project! This is an open-source Android app where users will be able to set alarms that repeat at custom intervals. We are in the early stages of development, and this is an exciting opportunity for contributors to join the project and help shape its future.

## Project Vision

Our goal is to build a simple, intuitive, and efficient alarm app using modern Android development tools such as **Kotlin**, **Jetpack Compose**, and **MVVM architecture** with clean code practices. The app will allow users to set repeating alarms, offering a smooth user experience while maintaining battery efficiency.

## Why Join?

This project is a great opportunity for Android developers, both beginners and experienced, to collaborate and learn from each other. Whether you're familiar with Jetpack Compose, MVVM, or just starting out with Kotlin, this project will provide a learning experience while contributing to an open-source Android app.

### What You Can Learn:
- Building an Android app from scratch using **Jetpack Compose**.
- Implementing the **MVVM** architecture with a focus on **clean code**.
- Writing efficient, readable, and maintainable Kotlin code.
- Working in a collaborative team environment, contributing to open-source.
- Managing state and lifecycle in modern Android apps.

## How to Contribute

We welcome all contributions, whether you're fixing bugs, improving documentation, or working on features. Here’s how to get started:

Click the **Fork** button at the top of this repository and clone the forked project to your local machine:
```bash
git clone YOUR_OWN_FORKED_REPO_LINK_HERE
```

### 2. Set Up the Project
Since the project is in its early stages, we’ll be building the app structure together. To set up the project for development:
- Ensure you have **Android Studio** installed.
- We’ll be using **Kotlin** as the programming language and **Jetpack Compose** for the UI. 
- The architecture follows the **MVVM pattern** with a focus on **clean code** principles.

### 3. Choose an Issue or Feature
Check the **Issues** tab for open issues or upcoming features. We will also be sharing a roadmap to guide development efforts.

### 4. Create a Feature Branch
Once you decide what you’d like to work on, create a feature branch:
```bash
git checkout -b feature-name
```

### 5. Start Coding and Learning
This project is a collaborative learning experience, so don't hesitate to ask questions or seek help. We encourage peer reviews, code discussions, and knowledge sharing.

### 6. Open a Pull Request
After completing your work, push your changes to your fork and open a pull request:
```bash
git push origin feature-name
```

## Guidelines for Contributions

- **Code Quality**: Ensure your code is modular, follows Kotlin best practices, and uses clean code principles.
- **Documentation**: Provide documentation for any features you implement.
- **Collaboration**: Feel free to ask questions in the discussions, and be open to feedback during code reviews.
